##Ansible Best Practises
Problem that is being addressed is to complexity of the ansible projects, soon as the project starts grow. Organization of the code in this repository shows how it is possible solve following issues:

* How to manage external roles
* Usage of variables
* Naming 
* Staging
* Complexity of plays




##Directory Layout

    production.ini            # inventory file for production stage
    development.ini           # inventory file for development stage
    test.ini                  # inventory file for test stage
    
    group_vars/
        all                   # variables under this directory belongs all the groups
        webservers            # here we assign variables to webservers groups
        postgresql            # here we assign variables to postgresql groups
    plays
        ansible.cfg           # Ansible.cfg file that holds all ansible config
        webservers.yml        # playbook for webserver tier
        postgresql.yml        # playbook for postgresql tier

    roles/
        requirements.yml      # All the infromation about the roles
